First, when a link is search the hostname gets converted by the local 
dns server into a 4 charatcher ip address. Each link has an endpoint looking for a 
specific server and params or queries searching for a specific request. Once the root
dns has the answer, it is sent back to the browser. Each protocol will grant a public less secure
access and the https, if your looking for a secure protocol, is what you want to see on your return. 
Every computer has its own ip address or localhost, 127.0.0.1.
